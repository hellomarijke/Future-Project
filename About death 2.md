In their past lives, it was believed that a person was part of everything, even after they died. They called this "The Stream." So, they believed The Stream is everything. Being in The Stream is supposed to feel like floating in a body of water, where the soul is aware of all the emotions and feelings of the wider world.

However, upon their death, Aainaye were not (a part of) everything, or this so-called Stream. Instead, they were (part of) nothing. The nothingness was experienced as some sort of void, where Aainaye didn't feel emotions and feelings of the wider world, and also didn't feel their own emotions. Instead, they felt nothing, like they never existed. It felt more like being in some sort of limbo.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">How does it feel to experience 'nothing', why is it so horrifying? Elaborate more</mark>

After their awakening, they became scared of this unknown void, because never again would they want to be (part of) nothingness anymore. They started to refer to this as "The Void."

However, they are not scared of death (The Stream) itself. What happened did not feel like a normal death, and Aainaye is convinced that death isn't bad, just that they experienced it in an abnormal way, and they want to find out why.

*I am not scared of The Stream. I think it's beautiful. Or, it should be. I just experienced something that wasn't The Stream, and it felt wrong. I need to find out why.
