==**Introduction**

It is the 9th day of the Howling Moon when something that is long dead awakens from its centuries-long slumber. Above ground it is sweltering hot in the Al-Maghrib Al-Wafir desert, but deep below the surface water runs free through the dark maze of an immense cave system. It is there that Aainaye, still nameless then, wakes up - confused, a little stiff, but with an immediate sense of curiousity. The only thing they have with them is a ==xxx sword==, imbued with xxx and xxx, and a hairpin in the shape of a Lotus. [More info on items]

Through the maze, they find their way to an underground clearing and through a small opening in the wall they experience sunlight for the first time in hundreds of years. It is also the first time Aainaye is able to notice their appearance - and discover they look different then before. But how they used to look as something that Aainaye quickly start describing as "Before", they don't know. In fact, they don't know anything about Before, or when Before even is and was.

Currently, their body is void of any skin, their bones on full display and covered in dust and fungi, feeding of the calcium still present in the bones. There is nothing on them, just two holes where their eyes should have been, and the world is blacker than any void Aainaye can imagine. What is more, the fungi whisper to them. And Aainaye answers.

==**General characteristics**==

**Themes**: Identity, life/death
**About death**: In their past lives, it was believed that a person was part of everything, even after they died. They called this "The Stream." So, they believed The Stream is everything. Being in The Stream is supposed to feel like floating in a body of water, where the soul is aware of all the emotions and feelings of the wider world.

However, upon their death, Aainaye were not (a part of) everything, or this so-called Stream. Instead, they were (part of) nothing. The nothingness was experienced as some sort of void, where Aainaye didn't feel emotions and feelings of the wider world, and also didn't feel their own emotions. Instead, they felt nothing, like they never existed. It felt more like being in some sort of limbo.

After their awakening, they became scared of this unknown void, because never again would they want to be (part of) nothingness anymore. They started to refer to this as "The Void."

However, they are not scared of death (The Stream) itself. What happened did not feel like a normal death, and Aainaye is convinced that death isn't bad, just that they experienced it in an abnormal way, and they want to find out why.

*I am not scared of The Stream. I think it's beautiful. Or, it should be. I just experienced something that wasn't The Stream, and it felt wrong. I need to find out why.

==**Personal characteristics**:

**Birth date**: Unknown
**Death date**: Unknown
**Hometown**: Unknown

**Awakening date**: 9th day of the Howling Moon
**Location**: Al-Maghrib Al-Wafir desert
**Manner of death**: Unknown

**Primary objective**: Unravelling their identity. Who were they and who are they now? In order to know who they are now, they want to know who they were - this also includes exploring the world as it is compared to finding clues as to how it was before.
**Secondary objective**: This leads to the secondary objective: wanting to find out how they exactly died, who killed them, and why.

**Fears**: 
- Themselves. Are they now who they were before? Would the before-them be disappointed in the now-them, or would the now-them be disappointed before-them?
- The Void (see "about death")
**Dreams and desires**: A great desire to belong in the current world - and have a pair of eyes to call their own. 
**Secrets**: It becomes obvious Aainaye is murdered, but they simply tell people they died. When people ask how they died, they shrug.
**Quirks**: 
- Wants to know everyone's eyecolour (and writes them down in their logbook), because eyes are the mirrors of life and Aainaye doesn't have them (but greatly wishes to; see desires).  Therefore, they have an obsession with colorful buttons and try to put them in their eyesockets to create the "illusion" to have eyes.
- They also love children and animals, because they believe they don't judge by appearance as much (which is actually not true and often scarws them away)
- They are blind (since they don't have eyes) but can "see" through the whispers of the funghi, which they call The System.
- Often dislocates or even loses their left arm - did something happen to it when they were still alive?

==**Mental characteristics**

**Known languages**: Common and Old Language
**Lures (what is your character drawn to?)**: Everything related to the circle of life and death - from living things such as animals, funghi, and plants, to dead things.
**Savvies (what are they familiar with and/or very good at doing?)**:
**Ineptities (what are they simply unable to understand?)**: How others can be so worried about death.
**Hobbies**: Exploring the world and noting everything down they can find, collecting buttons, connecting with people (even though they know it's smarter to stay away from others)

==**Philosophical characteristics**

**Morality**: They have a sense of morality and a deep appreciation of life and death. However, they perception of judgement is slightly skewed from the standard, which can make them appear more unhinged then they actually are. 
**Perception**: Aainaye perceive situations neutrally until they know what is going on. They like to observe before acting: death has made them patient, so fighting is in their opinion not always necessary (until the right moment is there to strike). As for those they perceive as friends or allies, they will do anything for them. They know, due to being connected to The System, how everything else is also connected and thus part of a clockwork, and they want to do everything in their might to be part of this clockwork, especially this specific gear that represents their friend group. They believe that without a system, one cannot survive. This also means that their perception of death is very neutral: dying doesn't mean the end (they are the living proof!), so killing something for the greater good isn't as much of a problem for them as it is for others. Furthermore, fungi are known for feeding on living hosts. Aainaye believes that sometimes people have to die in order for others to live, and for the world to become stronger.
