==**General characteristics**==

**Name**: Rishi
**Race**: Half orc (half human)
**Age**: Around 60
**Appearance**: Grayish skin tone and prominent teeth (however, one is missing). A face and body full of scars, but eyes that are kind and patient. He is somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and slightly taller (around 1.90m). He seems older than he actually is. His voice is heavy and loud, sounding like an older male, with a heavy emphasis on the R.
**Personality**: A gentle man, scarred by his past. He is very patient with [[Lakshmi]], who is not his real child but sees her as one of his own. He is very protective over her, since she is a human child and therefore more vulnerable. He dedicated his whole life of being a dad, and encourages Lakshmi to discover the world around her, which she has a great interest in. He noticed she is an extremely bright kid and is incredibly proud of her. He gave her a [[magnifying glass]] he accidently found close to the city walls. Although he encourages Lakshmi's brightness, he is very hostile towards [[Aainaye]] and wishes [[Lakshmi]] wouldn't be in contact with them. He views them as an abolishment, and a danger to the bright Lakshmi who will already have a life with not many possibilities, simply by living in the slums.  

==**Background**

Rishi was part of a vicious group of half-orcs, often in battle with humans and orcs alike. In one of their raids of a human town, he found a baby in the middle of the burning ashes. She was still alive, and although bodies laid around her, she didn't seem scared of Rishi. In the spur of a moment, he decided to pick her up and spare her life. This did not go well in his troupe, and he was exiled. He took [[Lakshmi]] to the slums to bring her up in relative safety: hoping that in the future he could find a way to put [[Lakshmi]] in university.
