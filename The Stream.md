Aainaye is from a region where they held, like all other cultures, certain beliefs about dying and death. In this culture, they called death The Stream, refering to a large body of water where all live begins and ends, and where everything is connected. It was also seen as the veins of the Earth.

When alive, it was also believed that one was still a part of this Stream (as everything was believed to be connected), though upon dying one would return to their previous form of energy and be able to float in this Stream on a different level.

For instance, when alive, the physical form was like a stone in the river, still part of it but in a way 'seperate' from the water itself, though the water would shape the stone and the stone would go where the water would take them. The larger stone would turn to sand, and the sand would then turn again into water. This metaphore was often used to explain the life cycle of a person. 

The non-physical form (like the energy of a person) was thus compared to a molecule that, together with thousands of other molecules, formed the water.

==**Origin story**==

*Before, everything was water. After thousands, million years of water, the water got lonely. After another million years, Water was finally able to make a stone. To lived together for many years, but the stone turned lonely. And so it asked the water if it could shape more stones. The water agreed, since it didn't want the stone to be lonely in its big, vast body. It made the water lonely as well. So ,with a big wave, it smashed the stone in multiple pieces, big ones, small ones, and spread them accross its body. However, in the end of everything, jagged stones turned to round ones, and the round ones turned to sand, and the sand turned, once again, to water.*
